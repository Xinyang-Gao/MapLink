This is a small client mod that allows you to see other players from further away on servers.
It does this by getting the position data from Dynmap, Bluemap, Squaremap or Pl3xMap running on the server and displaying it with waypoints in [Xaero's Minimap](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap) and [Worldmap](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map).

The AFK display feature can be uses without having a map mod installed.

### Features
- see player positions on Xaero's Minimap _(see more below)_ and Worldmap
- AFK display in tab list
- configurable trough Modmenu and cloth config
- **==> [Roadmap](https://github.com/users/thebuildcraft/projects/1)**

### Supported Maps
- Dynmap
- Bluemap
- Squaremap
- Pl3xMap

### How to use
You just have to add the server you want to use this mod on to the list in the config:<br>
"server ip" is the ip you use to connect to the minecraft server<br>
"online map link" is the weblink to the map online  (just copy it from the browser)<br>
And make sure to set the "map-type" correctly!
